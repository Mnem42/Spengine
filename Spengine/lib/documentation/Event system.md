The difference between a `DelegatingEventQuene` and a `SimpleEventQuene` is 
that a `DelegatingEventQuene` calls the handler directly, but a 
`SimpleEventQuene`  doesn't do anything with any events received, and only 
acts as a container for events. 

## Event handlers

### Calling

There are multiple different ways to call an event. The applicability of each
depends on the type of event and how it's triggered. For example, calling 
convention B makes more sense for things like IO input events, because it isn't 
a problem if any events are not handled. 

However, calling convention A makes more sense for events that have to be responded 
to, or for long running background processes like downloading a file.

#### Calling convention A

In this option, the handler is instructed by the quene to handle an event sent
by the caller. The handler directly notifies the caller if it succeeds.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
participant C   as Caller
participant H   as Handler
participant MT  as Quene
participant ERR as Error handler

C-)MT:    Do something
MT->>H:   Do what the caller said
H-->>ERR: Error details
H-->>C:   Notify caller if error occurs
H-->>C:   Send return data <br/> if required
```

#### Calling convention B

In this option, the handler polls the quene to check if there's something it 
has to respond to, and calls it. It directly notifies the caller if there's an 
error and also directly provides any return data. The handler should also
provide a way to set the severities of different types of error.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
participant C   as Caller
participant H   as Handler
participant MT  as Quene
participant ERR as Error handler

C-)MT:    Do something
loop
H->>MT:   Do I have to do anything?
H-->>MT:  Delete event
H-->>ERR: Log error if event is locked by another handler
H-->>ERR: Error details
H-->>C:   Notify caller if error occurs
H-->>C:   Send return data <br/> if required
end
```
